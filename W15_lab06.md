- Board.java: Main file that runs the game.  It handles what is drawn, and what methods to call.  
- Character.java: Parent class for a Character (Pacman & Ghost)  Includes some implementation, and prototypes.  
- GamePlayed.java: A class that contains information about a game.  Used for leaderboard.  
- Ghost.java: Ghost class determines ghost information, as well as handles controls and movement.  Also include AI for ghosts.  
- Grid.java: Contains level data, relevant methods, and fruit spawning methods.  
- Leaderboard.java: Leaderboard class that includes a list of high scores.  
- LeaderboardGUI.java: Actual interface of the leaderboard.  Should be intergrated with Board.java  
- Node.java: Used for pathfinding algorithm in Ghost.java  
- Pacman.java: Main function that initializes the board and creates the window.  
- PacPlayer.java: Pacman class determines pacman information, as well as handles controls for movement.  
- ScoreLoader.java: Saves and loads the high scores.  

The current game functions well, but there are still many improvements that can be made.  For example, the ghosts and pacman can pass eachother if they both go through a tunnel at the same time.  This cannot be effectively fixed with current collision implementation since the tunnels function by waiting until the character is completely out of the last tile, before wrapping them around to the other side.  This acts similar to a teleport, and allows the character to teleport through without colliding.  It can be fixed by maximizing the hitbox of pacman to the entire 24x24 picture, but this is too sensitive and appears unfair.

Improvements could also be made to the fruit spawning.  currently, it will randomly look for open spots on the grid which is inefficient since it may search a taken spot multiple times, and when the map is completely full, it will essentially need to search the entire grid to find a space.  To fix this, I have left a note in the code:  
You could have an ArrayList that holds Point Objects of locations that the Pacman has eaten pellets.  
- Create ArrayList<Point> in Grid.java & initialize
- Add new Point every time Pacman eats pellet/fruit in PacPlayer.java

When it is time to spawn a fruit, choose a random Point from this ArrayList (int) (Math.random() * list.size()), then remove the point where you spawned the fruit. When a level is complete, make sure you clear this ArrayList using list.clear()  
To prevent the fruit from spawning on Pacman, just cross-check that the spawning location != any of the Pacman location (use a loop on pacmen array for this so you handle multi-player mode)

Another improvement would be to integrate the leaderboard.  This will allow all windows to be contains within a single window rather than having multiple windows to handle different tasks.  I have already integrated the help window.  Integrating the windows also help to keep a consisten theme across everything.  I have not actually looked too much into this, but you could look at Board.java for examples of how the help window and other windows are rendered.

The most important improvement in my opinion would be to create a map data structure that holds the map data (walls), as well as the pacman and ghost spawning position.  This would allow different spawning points for different levels.  Currently, all levels and spawn position are hard coded, which does not allow for much change, and results in somewhat messy code.  This class should also be made serializable so that it can be saved to a file.  Once this is done, you can create a map editor, that will read from the data structure, and render the map accordinginly.  Allow users to make changes to the map, and save it.  The exact layout of this is up to you.

Something else that can be done, is to make the size and position of sprites rendered be dynamically sized according to the window size.  If this is done, you can allow the window to be resized, and instead of rendering everything as a constant size, you can resize them to the screen.  This will allow the user to choose how big they want to make the window.  To do this, you will probably want to create some static constant in Board.java, and update it whenever the window is resized.  Then, you want to go through each of the drawing functions throughout all files, and make it so that the size of everything rendered is dependent on the static variable.
